# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I had never done or thought much about 3D design or how to set one up before this project. There are many skills that I took away from this project, such as the placement of objects, texturing, and lighting angles. 

# What design process did you follow for your project work?
I tried to recreate the scene as close to the original picture taken as possible. I wanted to give it a true-to-life feeling. The placement of the objects in the scene, the lighting, and as close as possible to the textures was used. 

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I plan on using my degree to help smaller businesses with programs for their companies. With the tactics and skills, I received from this course and project I will be better able to assist these businesses with the design and implementation of their software. Rather that be with a mockup of a design or with the final product. 

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Because I had never done anything with OpenGL, I had to do much research on the subject. There were shapes and design features that had to be used in the project that was not included in the course material. The code that I did find was in different formats than what I was using. Because of this, it took time to convert the code to work with mine. 

# How did iteration factor into your development?
Each iteration added something new to the final project. Because I was learning as I went, each version added something new, rather that being a new object added to the scene or modifying the code for better usage of resources or reusability.  

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
The code that was provided in the milestones differed from the code on the web page we were using as an instructional guide called Learning Opengl. It was also different from the videos provided. Much of the time spent on the completion of the project was spent combining all the codes into one coherent program that would work together to produce the end results.  

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I believe any knowledge gained is an asset to one’s success. Knowledge is power. Applied in future educational pathways will make future classes and studies easier to accomplished. If at any point I choose to change the direction of my profession towards a graphics interest, the knowledge I gained here will be prudent. Applied in future professional pathway, this knowledge could give me an opportunity to gain an edge on the competition rather than it be a job, promotion, or to gain a client.
